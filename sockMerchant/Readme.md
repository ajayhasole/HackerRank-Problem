Here's a simple README file that specifies the input and output for the sock merchant program:

```markdown
# Sock Merchant

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, the number of socks, and an array `ar` representing the colors of each sock. Your task is to determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors can be formed.

## Input

- **n**: An integer representing the total number of socks (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- **ar**: An array of integers where each integer represents the color of a sock (1 ≤ ar[i] ≤ 100).

### Example Input
```
9
10 20 20 10 10 30 50 10 20
```

## Output

- An integer representing the total number of matching pairs of socks.

### Example Output
```
3
```

## Explanation
In the example input, there are:
- 3 socks of color `10` (which forms 1 pair)
- 2 socks of color `20` (which forms 1 pair)
- 0 socks of color `30` (which forms 0 pairs)
- 0 socks of color `50` (which forms 0 pairs)

Thus, the total number of pairs is `1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2`.
