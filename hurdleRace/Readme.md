# Hurdle Race

## Input

The input consists of two parts:

1. **First line:**
   - Two space-separated integers `n` and `k`:
     - `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000): The number of hurdles in the race.
     - `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100): The height the person can jump.

2. **Second line:**
   - A space-separated list of `n` integers: The heights of the hurdles in the race. Each integer is between 1 and 1000.

---

## Output

The output should be a single integer representing the number of potions the person needs to drink to jump over the tallest hurdle. If the tallest hurdle is shorter than or equal to the person's jump height (`k`), the output should be `0` (indicating no potions are needed).
