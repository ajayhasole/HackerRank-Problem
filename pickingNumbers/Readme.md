# Picking Numbers Problem

## Problem Description
The program calculates the size of the largest subset of numbers in an array such that the absolute difference between any two numbers in the subset is at most 1. This is based on the "Picking Numbers" problem.

## Input Format

The program reads input from a file named `input.txt` with the following format:

1. The first line contains a single integer, `n`, representing the size of the array.
2. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

### Example Input:
```
6
4 6 5 3 3 1
```

## Output Format

The program writes the result to a file named `output.txt`. The result is a single integer representing the size of the largest subset where the absolute difference between any two numbers is at most 1.

### Example Output:
```
3
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```
6
4 6 5 3 3 1
```

- The numbers in the array are `[4, 6, 5, 3, 3, 1]`.
- The largest subset that satisfies the condition (absolute difference â‰¤ 1) is `[3, 3, 4]`, which has a size of `3`.

### Output:
```
3
```
